/*Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice
for an item sold at the store.An Invoice should include four pieces of information as
instance variables‐a part number(type String),a partdescription(type String),
a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item  (double). Your
class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. In addition,
provide a method named getInvoice Amount that calculates the invoice amount
(i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value.
If thequantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, 
it should be set to 0.0. Write atest application named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.*/
